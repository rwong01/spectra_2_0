# Building a BOM helper
## About this project
Building PCB's is a long and hard process. And when it comes time to manufacture your board, the last thing you want to find out is that the parts in your BOM (bill of materials) are out of stock or not available from the suppliers you need

## What it does
Feed the BOM helper a part number and it will help you find suitable replacements!
